# Task 5 - Algorithms

## Introduction

Welcome to the Flight Reallocation System documentation. This system provides functionality to reallocate passengers across flights within a network of airports based on certain criteria such as flight capacity and cancellation status. This document outlines the system's functionality, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

### Prerequisites

```
Python 3.x
Required libraries:
networkx
pandas (optional, for data analysis)
matplotlib (optional, for network visualization)
```

### Running the Code

#### Clone the Repository:
